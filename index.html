<h3 class="text-left" style="margin-right:600px;margin-left:650px;">Intro to the 20's</h3>
</br>
<br>
<p style="margin-left:650px;margin-right:150px;">The Roaring 20's got its name from the extragavant never-ending parties where alochol
    flowed freely despite prohibition laws in place. During this time period, societal norms were redefined
    as women wore their hair short in a bob style and shorter dresses with no waistline. Make-up was normalized
    thanks to silent film actresses, who were idolized by the people and even used in ads to promote products.
    Gender norms were being broken by young women who wanted the freedom to do as they pleased, and this time
    period was right after World War I, also known as The Great War, so after it ended the younger generations
    partied hard and drowned their sorrows in alcohol. 
</p>
</br>

<p style="margin-left:650px;margin-right:150px;">Although the 1920's is better known for the wild parties and flappers, there were many protests and changes
    happening during this time. Women advocated for their rights and workers protested for better working
    conditions and higher wages.

<h3 style="margin-left:130px">Party Culture</h3>
<br></br>

<p style="margin-left:130px;margin-right:650px;">Party culture was an important aspect of the 20's, and its influence can be seen even in modern times as
    people dress up as flappers during Halloween. Although Prohibition laws were passed to prevent the sale of alcohol, many began making their own--these
    people were known as bootleggers. Alcohol flowed freely in any speakeasy (illegeal hole in the wall places
    that sold alcohol--these were often run by criminals looking to make easy money) where young men and women gathered to dance and party.
    And of course no party was complete without jazz music. Popular dances during this time include the Charleston, the Fox Trot,
    Texas Tommy, and the Shimmy. 
</p>
<br></br>
<p style="margin-left:130px;margin-right:650px;">This aspect of the 1920's is reflected in Fitzgerald's novel "The Great Gatsby", where Gatsby throws elaborate and illegal parties with alcohol to impress
    his former flame, Daisy.

    <h3 style="margin-left:130px">Iconic Figure: Josephine Baker</h3>
    <br></br>
    
    <img src="https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NDg0MDU4MjY3MTI1MjYz/josephine-bakerjpg.jpg" alt="Josephine Baker" class="float-right" style="margin-right:150px">
    
    
    <p style="margin-left:130px;margin-right:650px;">Iconic figures during the 1920's included muscians, artists, authors, and scientists. These people were idolized by
        the people and were often used to sponsor products in ads. One such notable icon was Josephine Baker; Baker was not only a singer and dancer but also dedicated her life
        to her charity work.
    </p>
    <br></br>
    <p style="margin-left:130px;margin-right:650px;">Baker was born in St. Louis, MO in 1906 but moved to Paris in 1925 to pursue a career in entertainment. Her chances of success were hindered in America by the racism
        and sexism of that time. Baker was a hit in Paris and was one of the most famous music hall entertainers, one of her most iconic performaces was at the Folles-Berg√®re,
        where she performed in a banana outfit. However, she did more than perform; she also adopted 12 children and helped them complete their education because she had to leave school when she was 8.
        Like many other celebrities, Baker played a vital role in the war efforts and encouraged people to support the war and was a member of the Free French forces.
